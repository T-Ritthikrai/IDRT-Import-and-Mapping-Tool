20000001$Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation (SMQ)$1$Torsade de pointes (TdP) is a form of rapid ventricular tachycardia which can be hereditary or acquired. In some acquired forms, there appear to be genetic predispositions related to sub-clinical potassium channel abnormalities. On electrocardiogram (ECG),TdP is associated with or preceded by polymorphic QRS complexes; other ECG changes include prolonged QT or QTc interval, prominent U waves, T wave alternans or bizarre T wave aberrations, and long-short sequences. TdP can resolve spontaneously, but acquired forms often recur until the underlying cause is corrected, and can progress to ventricular fibrillation. Clinical manifestations include palpitations, dizziness, syncope, and, rarely, sudden death.$Zipes DP. Specific arrhythmias: diagnosis and treatment.

20000025$Asthma/bronchospasm (SMQ)$1$Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which mast cells, eosinophils and T lymphocytes play a role. The inflammation causes an increased airway responsiveness to a variety of stimuli leading to bronchospasm/ bronchoconstriction. Clinically, asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and cough. Characteristic of these episodes is variable airflow limitation; this may resolve or partly reversed either spontaneously or with treatment. 1, 2. 3 Bronchospasm/bronchoconstriction is defined as airflow limitation due to contraction of bronchial smooth muscle; an improvement in airflow in response to bronchodilators is essential for the diagnosis. Bronchospasm, along with airway inflammation, is a contributing factor to airway limitation in asthmatics. "Aggravated bronchospasm/bronchoconstriction" and "paradoxical bronchospasm" are terms used to describe an unexpected episode of bronchospasm related to inhalation aerosol treatment; its causes can be either the inhalation procedure or irritation due to the aerosol (active or inactive ingredients). 1$1.

However, inclusion of these PTs (particularly PT Intentional overdose) substantially increased the number of cases identified by both the depression and suicide/self-injury searches in phase I testing. It was the practice of the testing company to encode any case where the patient was prescribed a dose that exceeded the maximum-labeled daily dose as an intentional overdose, regardless of whether or not an overdose was being reported. Therefore, many of these cases do not involve true "overdoses". For databases where this is a common practice, it would not be unreasonable to conduct an initial search excluding these two PTs.

20000041$Hyperglycaemia/new onset diabetes mellitus (SMQ)$1$Diagnosis based on elevated levels of fasting plasma glucose or random plasma glucose plus symptoms. Hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus (DM) occurs as a result of reduced insulin secretion, decreased glucose usage, or increased glucose production. Type I DM: About 10% of all cases; Insulin deficiency resulting from autoimmune beta cell destruction (type IA) or idiopathic (type IB). Type II DM: About 90% of all cases; Heterogeneous disorder of glucose metabolism characterized by variable degrees of insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion, and increased hepatic glucose production. Drugs have been associated with hyperglycemia that can progress to new onset DM: Can mimic type I or II; Mechanisms: Diminished insulin production, inhibited insulin secretion, and reduced beta cell volume (e.g., cyclosporine); Autoimmune destruction of beta cells and increased insulin antibody titers (e.g., interleukin-2); Hormone stimulated gluconeogenesis and decreased insulin sensitivity (e.g., glucocorticosteroids); Decreased insulin sensitivity (e.g. protease inhibitors); Often reversible by discontinuation of drug, or can be controlled with oral antidiabetic agents and/or insulin. Common findings/symptoms: polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, weight loss, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Acute complications: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) particularly type I; Nonketotic hyperosmolar state (NKHS) particularly type II diabetes; Both can result in neurologic symptoms including coma. Long term complications are microvascular (e.g., retinopathy), macrovascular (e.g., coronary artery disease), neuropathic (e.g., paresthesias).$1. Oki JC and Isley WL. Diabetes mellitus.

The CIOMS WG has concluded that these PTs need to be included for completeness sake, and if the narrow search identifies a sufficient number of cases for a review then cases reporting only these PTs may not need to be reviewed further. However, should the narrow search return an insufficient number of cases for review, then cases reporting these PTs should be reviewed to determine if the patient in those cases appear to be at high risk for subsequent development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia. Testing in the regulatory database similarly retrieved "noise" for PT Weight increased; however, the CIOMS WG development team agreed that this term is relevant for the scope of the SMQ and should remain in the query for now.

20000042$Interstitial lung disease (SMQ)$1$Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are a heterogeneous group of conditions that involve the alveolar walls and perialveolar tissue. The ILDs are nonmalignant and are not caused by any defined infectious agents. Approximately 180 known individual diseases are characterized by interstitial lung involvement, either as primary disease or as a significant part of a multiorgan process, as occurs in collagen vascular diseases. The initial response is inflammation in the air spaces and alveolar walls. If the disease is chronic, inflammation spreads to adjacent portions of the interstitium and vasculature and eventually produces interstitial fibrosis. Scarring and distortion of lung tissue leads to significant derangement of gas exchange and ventilatory function. One approach to classification is to separate ILDs into two groups based on 1) known causes or 2) unknown causes. Each group can be further subdivided based on the presence or absence of granulomas.$Not provided$$13.0$A$N$

20000044$Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (SMQ)$1$Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare but potentially fatal disorder characterized by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic dysfunction as a complication of treatment with neuroleptic drugs. Symptoms similar to NMS have been reported in non-schizophrenic patients treated with dopamine-depleting drugs (such as reserpine), following withdrawal of indirect dopamine receptor agonists in patients with Parkinson's disease, and in association with intoxication from anticholinergic agents, amphetamines, lithium carbonate, cocaine, and phencyclidine.Diagnosis is usually based on the development of severe muscle rigidity and elevated temperature in patients treated with neuroleptic drugs that is accompanied by some combination of autonomic dysfunction (diaphoresis, incontinence, tachycardia, elevated or labile blood pressure), dysphagia, tremor, myoclonus, changes in consciousness ranging from confusion to coma, mutism, leucocytosis, and laboratory evidence of muscle injury such as elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) There does not appear to be any major differences in the clinical presentation reported with the traditional neuroleptics and the newer atypical antipsychotic agents.$1) Levenson JL.

The PTs mentioned in the case report are grouped according to the pre-determined categories. Occurrence of multiple PTs within a category is counted only once 2. The category that the term is attributed to is then multiplied by its empirically pre-determined "weight" (for example - 3 for categories Haematologic disorder, Serositis, and Immunologic disorder) and summed for all the categories 3. If this sum is greater than 6, it is proposed that the case report qualifies as a suspected SLE case report.

20000079$Convulsions (SMQ)$1$A seizure is a paroxysmal event due to abnormal, excessive, hypersynchronous discharges from an aggregate of central nervous system (CNS) neurons. Manifestations range from dramatic convulsive activity to experiential phenomena not readily discernible by an observer. Epilepsy should be distinguished from seizure. Epilepsy is a condition with recurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. Epilepsy is not a single disease entity and there are various epilepsy syndromes. Convulsions are the motor component of cerebral seizures. Convulsions are characterized by contractions of skeletal muscles, appearing abruptly and involuntarily. These contractions may be tonic or clonic and they may be focal or generalized. International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (1981): 1. Partial seizures a. Simple partial seizures (with motor, sensory, autonomic, or psychic signs) b. Complex partial seizures c. Partial seizures with secondary generalization 2. Primarily generalized seizures a. Absence (petit mal) b. Tonic clonic (grand mal) c. Tonic d. Atonic e. Myoclonic 3. Unclassified seizures a. Neonatal seizure b. Infantile spasms$1.

20000080$Pseudomembranous colitis (SMQ)$1$Pseudomembranous colitis is a severe, necrotizing process that involves the large intestine and occurs as a complication of antibiotic therapy. It occasionally occurs in the absence of antibiotic exposure; a predisposing condition is often present, e.g., recent bowel surgery, uraemia, intestinal ischaemia, chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation. The responsible pathogen is "Clostridium difficile", a member of the normal flora that overgrows in the presence of certain antibiotics or in the absence of normal bacterial flora due to other factors. Culture and toxin tests are available to identify C. difficile but a positive microbiology test(s) in the absence of clinical findings does not support a definitive diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis. Many reports of diarrhoea associated with antibiotic therapy may not have definitive diagnoses or specific tests for pseudomembranous colitis. Uncomplicated antibiotic-induced diarrhoea usually subsides spontaneously within two weeks of antibiotic discontinuation. For persisting symptoms or frank colitis, aggressive therapy may be required to restore balance of the bacterial flora within the lumen of the intestinal tract.$1.Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, 1999. 17th Edition. 2. Principles and Practices in Infectious Diseases, Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett, 2nd edition.$The terms Diarrhoea and Diarrhoea haemorrhagic should be included in the narrow search if the compound is an antibiotic; they should remain in the broad search if the compound is not an antibiotic. PT Clostridial infection includes LLTs for non-specific "clostridial" descriptions, as well as non-C. difficile species; cases identified via PT Clostridial infection should be carefully reviewed for relevance.$13.0$A$N$

20000116$Acute central respiratory depression (SMQ)$1$Acute central respiratory depression is a form of respiratory failure. Respiratory failure is defined as impairment of gas exchange between ambient air and circulating blood: problems in intrapulmonary gas exchange lead to hypoxemia and problems in the movement of gases cause hypercapnia. Depression of the respiratory center with resulting respiratory acidosis may occur: acutely with general anesthetics, sedatives, and head trauma, or chronically with sedatives, alcohol, intracranial tumors, and syndromes of sleep-disordered breathing, including the primary alveolar and obesity-hypoventilation syndromes. Acute hypoxemia may cause cardiac arrhythmia and coma. Alteration of consciousness is typical, confusion is common. Acute hypercapnia may cause: subtle personality changes and headache through to marked confusion and narcosis, cerebral vasodilation and increased CSF pressure, acidemia which, when severe, contributes to pulmonary arteriolar vasoconstriction, systemic vascular dilation, reduced myocardial contractility, hyperkalemia, hypotension, and cardiac irritability. Central respiratory depression mainly occurs in neonates of prematurity or in sleep apnea. Apnea of prematurity may be caused by CNS immaturity (central) or airway obstruction. Central sleep apnea (CSA) has two categories: 1. Hypercapnia with decreased ventilatory drive or a decreased ability to breathe. 2. Eucapnia or hypocapnia with increased ventilatory drive but sleep-induced apnea and periodic breathing. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is a discrete pattern of this form of CSA that may be seen in opiate associated respiratory depression.$The Merck Manual accessed online on 12 January 2006: http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec06/ch065/ch065c.html?qt=acute%20respiratory&alt=sh .

20000117$Psychosis and psychotic disorders (SMQ)$1$Psychosis refers to a mental disorder characterized by gross impairment in reality testing evidenced by: delusions, hallucinations, markedly incoherent speech, disorganized and agitated behavior, usually without apparent awareness on the patient's part. Psychosis is also used in a more general sense to refer to mental disorders in which mental functioning is sufficiently impaired as to interfere grossly with patient's capacity to meet the ordinary demands of life. Psychosis can be caused by many psychiatric disorders such as: schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic reaction, mania with psychosis, depression with psychosis, dementia, and delirium. Psychosis is also associated with: certain illicit drugs (cocaine, amphetamine, etc.) and medications (dopamine agonists, l-dopa, psychostimulants, etc.). In schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and brief psychotic disorder, the term psychotic refers to delusions, any prominent hallucinations, disorganized speech or disorganized or catatonic behavior.$Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 29th Edition, WB Saunders 2004.

20000131$Guillain-Barre syndrome (SMQ)$1$Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an immune-mediated, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP). Condition commonly follows a viral or mycoplasmal illness affecting the upper respiratory or alimentary tracts. Other antecedent events include certain vaccinations. Immune responses directed toward the infecting organisms likely cross-react with neural tissues including Schwann cell surface membrane (resulting in AIDP) or axonal membrane (acute axonal forms). GBS is usually characterized by: weakness or paralysis affecting more than one limb, usually symmetrically; loss of tendon reflexes; and increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein without pleocytosis. Other features may include: motor and sensory involvement; facial or cranial nerve involvement; and electrophysiologic evidence of demyelination. Acute form of GBS has a typically rapid evolution from hours to days, usually reaching maximum level of weakness within four weeks. Condition is classified as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) if patient's symptoms continue to progress beyond 4 weeks, or relapses occur. Peak disability in CIDP usually occurs in two months.$1) Textbook of Clinical Neurology, 2nd Edition, pp1085-1089, 2003. 2) Cecil Textbook of Medicine, 22nd Edition, pp 2379-2381, 2004. 3) Harrison's Internal Medicine, 16th Edition, pp 2513-2518, 2005. 4) Ferri F.

Please refer to the CIOMS WG documentation for detailed information on the algorithm, including category term lists. Category A (Narrow scope): terms representing GBS and sub-types. Category B (Broad scope): very commonly seen signs and symptoms from well-documented cases of GBS and its variants based on testing. Most terms relate to paresthesias, hypoesthesias and neuropathies. Category C (Broad): commonly seen signs, symptoms and diagnostic laboratory work based on testing. Category D (Broad): less frequently seen signs, symptoms and diagnostic laboratory work based on testing and signs, symptoms and diagnostic laboratory work that may be seen in GBS and its variants, but were not observed in the databases tested. Cases to be selected for further review would include any cases meeting any one of the following criteria: 1) at least one of the PTs listed for Category A (narrow scope) or 2) any case reporting at least two PTs from Category B or 3) any case reporting at least one PT from Category B and at least one PT from Category C or 4) any case reporting at least one PT each from Categories B, C and D. Certain drugs with high numbers of reports for terms such as paresthesias, hypoesthesias and muscular weakness, do capture more noise with the algorithm 2B and 1B+1C. It is recommended that for products such as these algorithm 1B + 1C + 1D is used is as it can eliminate much noise resulting in false hits.$13.0$A$N$

Mixed disorders such as encephalomyelitis, encephalomyeloradiculitis, or encephalo-myelopathy may present with overlapping symptoms. Signs and symptoms include: acute febrile illness characteristic of meningitis; confusion; behavioral abnormalities, including frank psychosis; altered level of consciousness; focal or generalized seizures; and focal neurological disturbances including aphasia, ataxia, hemiparesis, involuntary movements, cranial nerve deficits. Involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis may result in temperature dysregulation, diabetes insipidus, or development of SIADH. Characteristic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile consists of lymphocytic pleocytosis, mildly elevated protein concentration and normal glucose concentration. MRI, CT, and EEG abnormalities may occur.$1) Andreoli T, Behrman R, Bhattacharya B et al. Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 30th edition, dated 2003.

20000133$Noninfectious encephalopathy/delirium (SMQ)$1$Encephalopathy and delirium commonly have infectious or metabolic etiologies. May also be drug-induced (focus of this SMQ). In the case of metabolic disorders, it is possible that drug plays a contributory or causative role for underlying metabolic abnormality. Encephalopathy and delirium may be reported synonymously; however delirium may be narrower in scope. 1) Encephalopathy: Defined as any degenerative or diffuse disease of the brain that alters brain structure or function. Many sub-forms including: biliary; demyelinating; Wernicke's; secondary to infections; and secondary to drug-induced metabolic disorders such as hepatic encephalopathy, hyperammonemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, uremia. Leukoencephalopathy (encephalopathy with white matter lesions) may be secondary to drug-induced hypertension. Hallmark is altered mental state. Other symptoms include lethargy, fluctuation of level of consciousness, nystagmus, tremor, dementia, seizures, myoclonus, and muscle weakness. Cerebral edema is common. 2) Delirium (Acute confusional state): Delirium is a clinical state characterized by fluctuating disturbances in cognition, mood, attention, arousal, and self-awareness. May be due to primary brain diseases or secondary to other diseases. Causes include: metabolic; toxic (drugs); structural (vascular occlusion and cerebral infarction); intracerebral hemorrhage; primary or metastatic brain tumors; and infections. Signs and symptoms include clouding of consciousness with disorientation, changes in personality and mood, delusions, hallucinations (commonly visual), paranoia, withdrawal, agitation, disordered speech.$1) Jain K.

20000134$Noninfectious meningitis (SMQ)$1$ningitis is defined as an inflammation of the meninges. Commonly has an infectious etiology. May also be drug-induced (focus of this SMQ). 1) Aseptic meningitis: Characterized by CSF mononuclear pleocytosis and an absence of bacteria on examination and culture. May be caused by viruses. Rare but well-recognized complication of drug therapy. Drug-induced aseptic meningitis (DIAM) has distinct presentation with fever, neck stiffness, headache, confusion, nausea and vomiting. Major categories of causative agents are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antimicrobials, intravenous immunoglobulins, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. 2) Chronic meningitis: Meningeal inflammation lasting more than one month. Causative agents include chemotherapy drugs that are injected directly into the CSF (e.g., methotrexate), drugs used in organ transplantation (e.g., cyclosporine and OKT3) and even NSAIDs. Symptoms similar to those of acute bacterial meningitis, but develop more slowly and gradually; fever often less severe. Include headache, confusion, backache, weakness, numbness, and facial paralysis. Mixed disorders such as encephalomyelitis, encephalomyeloradiculitis, or encephalo-myelopathy may present with overlapping symptoms.$1) Andreoli T, Behrman R, Bhattacharya B et al.

20000135$Accidents and injuries (SMQ)$1$Accidents and injuries have been associated with use of medications, particularly older psychotropic medications, and especially patients with pre-existing high risk levels and/or continuing mental problems. In a study of falls in elderly, use of certain drugs (benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, and antidepressants) was an independent risk factor. Study on risk of accidental injury and benzodiazepines also confirmed an increased risk, especially in patients who had recently filled their prescription. "Accident" is defined as "an unplanned or unintended but sometimes predictable event leading to injury, e.g., in traffic, industry, or a domestic setting, or such an event developing in the course of a disease." In medicine, the term "injury" can have a very broad meaning. For the purpose of this SMQ, a more narrow definition is used, i.e., "to injure" is "to wound, hurt or harm". Focus of this SMQ is not on "metabolic" injury (toxicity, etc.), but on personal injury or accident to the individual as a result of altered perception, consciousness, attention, behavior, etc.$Wadsworth, EJK, Moss, SC, Simpson, SA, and Smith, AP.

Benzodiazepine tranquilizers and the risk of accidental injury. Am J Public Health 1990; 80: 1467-1470; Stedman's Medical Dictionary, 27th edition, 2000$Currently, many MedDRA PTs (e.g., PT Gallbladder injury) have dual links to groupings in SOC Injury, poisoning and procedural complications and groupings in "disorder" SOCs, implying that the terms can represent either metabolic or traumatic injury. This needs to be borne in mind when reviewing cases retrieved by this SMQ. Users should consider including cases coded to LLT Loss of teeth due to accident, extraction, or local periodontal disease - this term is not currently linked to an included PT in this SMQ but may retrieve cases of interest.$13.0$A$N$
20000136$Extravasation events (injections, infusions and implants) (SMQ)$1$Extravasation of drug product administered by venous access is a local complication can be associated with pain and swelling. Can be associated with pain and swelling. Some products may be associated with more serious sequelae including tissues necrosis. May be caused by: damage to the posterior wall of the vein or occlusion of the vein proximal to the injection site; occlusion of vein proximal to injection site. Extravasation is broadly defined as discharge or escape of blood or other fluid normally found in a vessel or tube, into the surrounding tissues. For purposes of this SMQ, "extravasation" relates to complication of drug delivery (injection, effusion, etc.) or to a device (includes potential sequelae of extravasation). Pain, erythema, and swelling are typically observed. Included: Terms with "extravasation" that are related to drug delivery or devices; terms with "injection", "infusion", "implant", "catheter" and "device" when combined with "induration", "edema", "effusion", "swelling", "irritation", "necrosis", and "ulcer". For future maintenance of this SMQ, PT terms with "instillation" could be considered for inclusion if they fit definition of SMQ; terms for administration site pain and erythema. Excluded: PT Extravasation blood and PT Extravasation of urine; PT Contrast media reaction; PT Inappropriate device irritation of tissue; PT Wrong technique in drug usage process; PT Systemic leakage ; "application site" terms; PT Injection site reaction and other plain "site reaction" PTs (e.g., PT Infusion site reaction) as these are non-specific.$Brown, S.

Semin Oncol Nurs 1992;8,2(May):133-147$Administration site pain and erythema are symptoms of extravasation (and are currently included in this SMQ) but can occur without it. These terms could retrieve more cases of interest than is practical in certain databases, depending on coding practices. This should be borne in mind when applying this SMQ. In general, "application site" terms are considered not appropriate for the scope of this SMQ, even though they did retrieve a few cases of interest during pre-production testing. MedDRA users should consider - based on their own data - if "application site" terms may have been used when coding cases related to extravasation and include relevant terms as needed$13.0$A$N$

20000141$Hyponatraemia/SIADH (SMQ)$1$Hyponatremia has occurred with a variety of medical conditions: adrenal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, nephritic syndrome, hypothyroidism, psychogenic polydipsia, hyperglycemia, acute or chronic renal failure, vomiting, diarrhea and SIADH. It can be: hypovolemic, i.e., associated with sodium and water depletion; hypervolemic, i.e., associated with fluid overload and edema; or isovolemic, i.e., associated with normal or modest extracellular volume expansion. SIADH occurs with a variety of medical conditions: neoplasms (particularly carcinomas), CNS disorders (stroke, intracranial hemorrhage or hematoma, encephalitis or meningitis, or acute psychosis), or pulmonary disorders (pneumonia, tuberculosis, asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Hyponatremia and SIADH are associated with drugs such as CNS active drugs (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen, thiazide diuretics and furosemide, sulfonylureas, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and many anti-neoplastic agents. Hyponatremia usually defined as serum sodium < 135 mEq/L. If severe (serum sodium<120 mEq/L) or rapid, presenting signs and symptoms are suggestive of water intoxication. Cerebral edema symptoms: headache, mental confusion, disorientation, encephalopathy, tremors, gait disturbances, convulsions, and coma. Other symptoms: nausea, vomiting, and muscle weakness or cramps. Other laboratory abnormalities: decreased plasma osmolality, increased or decreased urine osmolality, and increased or decreased urine sodium concentration.$Foote EF. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and diabetes insipidus. Drug-Induced Diseases: Prevention, Detection, and Management. Tisdale JE and Miller DA (Eds). American Society of Health-System Pharmacists: Bethesda, MD, 2005.$Diagnosis of hyponatremia and/or SIADH depends on presence of relevant laboratory abnormalities. Since these laboratory tests are likely to have been performed as part of the differential diagnosis and subsequently reported if abnormal for the more severe CNS manifestations of these conditions (such as convulsions or coma), cases reporting such severe manifestations and not also reporting the relevant abnormal laboratory results are excluded from this SMQ. Similarly, cases reporting less severe manifestations (such as nausea, vomiting, confusion, or headache) and not also reporting relevant abnormal laboratory results are also excluded from this SMQ since if the less severe symptoms are the only reported events they are likely to be uninformative and will contain insufficient information to asses a possible role of hyponatremia and/or SIADH in the etiology of the reported events.$13.0$A$N$
20000142$Hostility/aggression (SMQ)$1$Aggression: a form of behavior which leads to self-assertion; it may arise from innate drives and/or a response to frustration; it may be manifested by destructive and attacking behavior, by covert attitudes of hostility and obstructionism, or by a healthy self-expressive drive to mastery. Hostility: a tendency to feel anger toward and to seek to inflict harm upon a person or group.$Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 29th Edition, 2000. The On-Line Medical Dictionary, CancerWEB project, Dec 1998.$"Abused" terms (e.g., Verbally abused) rather than abuse terms were excluded as they are not likely to be self -inflicted. However, in some databases it may be necessary to include these terms because certain coding practices may include "abused" in place of "abuse".$13.0$A$N$
20000144$Ischaemic colitis (SMQ)$1$Ischaemic colitis is injury of large intestine that results from interruption of its blood supply. Caused by transient reduction in blood flow to colon. Most patients are elderly, but also occurs in younger ages associated with oral contraceptive use, vasculitis, hypercoagulable states. Clinical picture depends on degree and rate of development of ischemia. Acute fulminant ischaemic colitis: severe lower abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, and hypotension; dilatation of colon (severe cases); signs of peritonitis (severe cases). Subacute ischaemic colitis: most common clinical variant; produces lesser degrees of pain and bleeding (occurring over several days or weeks). Ischemic colitis is second most common cause of lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Diagnosis made by colonoscopy. Usually develops in absence of major vessel occlusion. Associated factors: decreased cardiac output; arrhythmia; trauma; surgery (e.g., aorto-iliac surgery); vasculitis; coagulation disorders; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; irritable bowel syndrome; specific drugs. More than two thirds of patients respond to conservative measures (IV fluids, bowel rest, antibiotics). Surgery rarely required$Satyaprasad V Alapati SV, Mihas AA. When to suspect ischemic colitis.

20000145$Haemodynamic oedema, effusions and fluid overload (SMQ)$1$Drug-induced edema has been described for a number of medications. Mechanisms: Enhanced sodium and water reabsorption by kidneys; potent vasodilators and calcium channel blockers (cause capillary leakage); non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit renal prostaglandin synthesis. Other drug products associated with peripheral edema: Antidepressants, estrogens, corticosteroids, COX-2 inhibitors. Edema definition: presence of abnormally large amounts of fluid in intercellular tissue spaces. Usually refers to demonstrable amounts of fluid in subcutaneous tissues. May be localized (due to venous or lymphatic obstruction or increased vascular permeability) or systemic (due to heart failure or renal disease). Sometimes designated by other terms according to site (ascites, hydrothorax, or hydropericardium). Massive generalized edema is called anasarca. Synonyms: dropsy and hydrops. Effusion definition: escape of fluid from lymphatics or blood vessels into a cavity or tissues; results from altered hydrostatic forces$Schroth, BE. Evaluation and management of peripheral edema.

20000146$Glaucoma (SMQ)$1$Group of eye diseases characterized by increased intraocular pressure (IOP). Causes pathologic changes in optic disk and defects in field of vision. Two main types: 1. angle-closure glaucoma (drainage canals within eye physically blocked) - sub-types: acute: sudden increase in IOP due to buildup of aqueous humor; chronic: may cause vision damage without symptoms; 2. open-angle glaucoma: drainage system remains open; may cause vision damage without symptoms (most common form of glaucoma). Other types of glaucoma: normal (or low) tension glaucoma (optic nerve damage but IOP is normal); childhood glaucoma; congenital glaucoma; secondary glaucoma (due to structural problem of eye including injury or other conditions). Causes of glaucoma: some have mutation of GLC1A gene (chromosome 1; gene product may be involved in eye pressure regulation); increased risk with elevated IOP, family history, ethnic background (e.g., glaucoma leading to blindness occurs 6-8 times more often in African Americans and Alaska Natives than in whites), and older age; other factors may contribute as people with normal IOP can get vision loss from glaucoma; some with high IOP never develop optic nerve damage. Symptoms include peripheral vision loss, headaches, blurred or foggy vision, difficulty adapting to darkness, halos around lights, severe eye pain, facial pain, pupil non-reactive to light, eye redness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bulging eye.$Dorland's Medical Dictionary; Merck Manual, Sec.8, Ch.100, Glaucoma http://www.merck.com/mrkshared/mmanual/section8/chapter100/100asp; http://www.emedicinehealth.com/glaucoma_overview/article_em.htm; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/disease/Glaucoma.html; Edward B.

20000147$Hypertension (SMQ)$1$Hypertension is defined as high arterial blood pressure. Causes are either unknown (essential or idiopathic hypertension) or associated with other primary diseases (secondary hypertension). Various criteria for its threshold range from 140 mm Hg systolic and 90 mm Hg diastolic to 200 mm Hg systolic and 110 mm Hg diastolic. Per 2003 ESH/ESC Hypertension Guidelines and NHLBI, optimal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg. Prehypertension is defined as blood pressure120-139/80-89 mm Hg. Newer definitions characterize hypertension as a complex progressive cardiovascular syndrome. The majority of patients are asymptomatic; hypertension is only identified by measuring blood pressure. Signs and symptoms include headache (only in severe hypertension); and other possibly related complaints: dizziness, flushed face, early fatigability, palpitation, and nervousness. Complaints referable to vascular effects include epistaxis, hematuria and blurring of vision. Common presentations of hypertensive emergencies are chest pain, dyspnoea, and neurologic deficit. Neurologic presentations include occipital headache, cerebral infarction or hemorrhage, visual disturbance, or hypertensive encephalopathy. No early pathological changes occur in primary hypertension. Ultimately, generalized arteriolar sclerosis develops, particularly in the kidneys. Hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential.$Journal of Hypertension 2003, Vol 21 No 10; Journal of Hypertension 1999, Vol 17 No 2; Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 16th Ed (2005). Part 8, Sect. 4; Dorland's Medical Dictionary, 30th Edition, 2003$Users of this SMQ are reminded to consider the possibility of searching for etiology, signs and symptoms and consequence terms excluded from this SMQ (see Table 2 in original CIOMS WG documentation) if hypertension may be a de novo signal. Users may also consider using other SMQs, such as Ischaemic heart disease (SMQ) and Central nervous system haemorrhages and cerebrovascular accidents (SMQ) to identify consequences of hypertension.$13.0$A$N$
20000148$Optic nerve disorders (SMQ)$1$Optic nerve transmits impulses generated by retinal photoreceptors to the brain. Damage anywhere along the optic nerve or to visual areas of brain can result in loss of vision. No overall definition for optic nerve disorders; SMQ focuses on optic neuropathy, optic neuritis (inflammation), and papilledema (swelling of optic nerve). Causes of optic neuropathy: toxins, including lead, methanol, ethylene glycol, tobacco or arsenic; compromised blood supply; nutritional deficiencies, especially vitamin B12; drugs, including chloramphenicol, isoniazid, ethambutol or digoxin. Loss of vision may be rapid (minutes or hours) or gradual over 2-7 days. One or both eyes can be affected, depending on cause. Vision can range from almost normal to complete blindness. Both eyes usually affected in optic neuropathy due to toxins or nutritional deficiency. Small area of vision loss at center of visual field slowly enlarges and can progress to complete blindness.$Merck Manual Online, published by Merck Research Laboratories$Nonspecific terms relating to the cranial nerves should be included in general or left out as a whole$13.0$A$N$

20000154$Demyelination (SMQ)$1$Demyelination: loss of myelin with preservation of the axons or fiber tracts. Group of diseases of nervous system with damage and destruction of myelin sheaths surrounding nerve fibers. Axons may be damaged as well. Mechanism of myelin damage may be different in various diseases. Impairs conduction of signals in affected nerves. Causes impairment in sensation, movement, cognition, or other functions. Most common demyelinating disease is multiple sclerosis. Other examples include central pontine myelinolysis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord. Central demyelination occurs within central nervous system (e.g., multiple sclerosis). Peripheral demyelination affects peripheral nervous system (e.g., Guillain-Barre syndrome). Other causes: genetic, autoimmune reaction, immunological disorders, nutritional or metabolic disorder, toxins (including some used in therapy such as anti-mitotic agents and radiotherapy), unknown.$http://www.uvm.edu/~jkessler/NP/neumyshe.htm#anchor4438902; Gale Encyclopedia of Neurological Disorders. 2005.

Broad terms for signs and symptoms of demyelinating diseases were excluded because they are in SMQ Peripheral neuropathy and SMQ Guillain-Barre syndrome. Some broad terms were also excluded as being too non-specific, related to advanced demyelination, or because of poor performance in SMQ testing.

20000155$Lens disorders (SMQ)$1$Most common cause of reduced vision (particularly cataracts). Responsible for about 35% of cases of visual impairment. Cataracts: may result from a number of processes (mainly age-related); usually progress slowly, but frequently only detected when reach a certain level of severity, or during opthalmological examination; symptoms often subtle (e.g., yellow vision) and often an anatomically severe cataract will not be associated with an equally severe functional loss of vision; symptoms may include glare, blurred vision, altered color perception, change of refraction, and monocular diplopia. A "sudden appearance" reported as an adverse event could actually result from a pre-existing condition. Care should be taken in evaluating apparent association between these lesions and drug therapy. Definitions (from multiple sources): Aphakia: absence of lens; may occur congenitally or from trauma, but is most commonly caused by extraction of a cataract; cataract: Congenital or acquired lack of clarity of the lens; clouding of the lens; opacity of lens or capsule of eye causing impairment of vision or blindness$West S Epidemiology of cataract: accomplishments over 25 years and future directions.

20000157$Eosinophilic pneumonia (SMQ)$1$Eosinophilic pneumonias are characterized by accumulation of eosinophils in alveolar spaces, interstitium, or both. Peripheral eosinophilia is common. Causes include: infections (especially helminthic); drug-induced pneumonitis (e.g., antibiotics, phenytoin, l-tryptophan); inhaled toxins (e.g., cocaine); systemic disease (e.g., Churg Strauss syndrome); allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Diagnosis based on opacities on chest X-ray and eosinophilia in peripheral blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or lung biopsy. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia has unknown etiology. Suspected to be allergic diathesis. Fulminant illness with cough, fever, weight loss, accompanied by or preceded by asthma in 50% of cases. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia also has unknown etiology but may be acute hypersensitivity reaction to unidentified inhaled antigen. Characterized by acute febrile illness with cough, dyspnea, malaise, myalgias, night sweats, and pleuritic chest pain. Loeffler's syndrome may be caused by parasitic infections, especially Ascaris lumbricoides, but identifiable agent often not found.

20000159$Thyroid dysfunction (SMQ)$1$Thyroid dysfunction can present as hypo- or hyperactive thyroidal function. Hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone deficiency. Primary hypothyroidism is due to thyroid disease; TSH is increased. Most common cause is autoimmune. Other common causes are post-therapeutic, occurring after radioactive iodine therapy, surgery, radiation, or lithium therapy. Secondary hypothyroidism occurs when hypothalamus produces insufficient TRH or pituitary produces insufficient TSH. Signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism include: cold intolerance, constipation, personality changes, dementia or frank psychosis, hoarse voice, facial puffiness, coarse hair and skin, fluid retention, decreased metabolism, paresthesias, decreased libido, menstrual irregularities, bradycardia, pericardial effusions. Hyperthyroidism is excessive production of iodinated thyroid hormones, T3 and T4. Graves' disease (toxic diffuse goiter) is most common cause and is characterized by hyperthyroidism, goiter, exophthalmos, pretibial myxedema. Inflammatory thyroid disease (thyroiditis) includes subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and silent lymphocytic thyroiditis. Drug-induced hyperthyroidism can result from lithium or interferon-alpha. Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism include: hyperactivity, increased sweating, increased appetite, weight loss, insomnia, weakness, frequent bowel movements, hypomenorrhea, tremor; tachycardia, atrial fibrillation. Eye signs include stare and eyelid retraction. Infiltrative ophthalmopathy is specific to Graves' disease.

20000174$Vasculitis (SMQ)$1$Vasculitis: inflammation of blood vessel walls. Clinical and pathological features vary depending on site and type of blood vessels affected. Primary vasculitis: vasculitis is the primary process. Examples are: temporal arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, and Wegener's granulomatosis. Vasculitis can be a secondary feature as with systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Vasculitis is characterized by inflammation of and damage to blood vessels. Vessel lumen is usually compromised. Vasculitis is associated with ischemia of tissues supplied by the involved vessel. A broad and heterogeneous group of syndromes may result from this process. Any type, size, and location of blood vessel may be involved and may be confined to a single organ, such as skin, or may simultaneously involve several organ systems.$Savage COS et al.

20000175$Conjunctival disorders (SMQ)$1$Conjunctiva is mucous membrane investing anterior surface of eye (bulbar conjunctiva) and posterior surface of eyelids (palpebral conjunctiva).  Disorders that affect conjunctiva include: acute conjunctivitis (viral, bacterial, inclusion, seasonal/allergic); chronic conjunctivitis (trachoma, perennial allergic, vernal keratoconjunctivitis); trauma (subconjunctival hemorrhage, foreign bodies, lacerations); degenerative conditions (Cogan's senile plaque, pinguecula, pterygium, concretions, retention cysts); blistering mucocutaneous diseases (cicatrical pemphigoid, Stevens-Johnson syndrome); pigmented lesions; and tumors.  [Note that the exclusion criteria for this SMQ excludes terms for known causes of or syndromes associated with conjunctival disorders (e.g., PT Pemphigoid).  Symptoms vary according to underlying problem.  Some common features are: complaints of a red eye; epiphora (excess tears); irritation, such as a foreign body sensation, due to presence of follicles or papillae; itching - hallmark of allergic conjunctivitis but may also occur in blepharitis or keratoconjunctivitis sicca; pain - generally mild (in absence of trauma, significant pain is unusual); and complaints of a discharge.$Scott, O.

20000176$Lacrimal disorders (SMQ)$1$Disorders that affect lacrimal gland and drainage system include: secretory dysfunction (lacrimal insufficiency); blockage of nasolacrimal duct; occlusion/stenosis of punctum; lacrimal gland neoplasms; and inflammations and infections.  Clinical manifestations include: excessive tear production; dry eyes.  Causes include: systemic diseases, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis; drugs (e.g., diuretics) which may also exacerbate symptoms of a dry eye.$Elkington, AR and Khaw, PT.  Eyelid and lacrimal disorders.  BMJ. 1988 August 13; 297(6646): 473 - 477; Westfall, CT. Lacrimal disease.  Curr Opin Ophthalmol, 1995, 6;V: 100 - 104; Thampy, H.

Merck Manual, 17th edition, 1999$Following testing and discussions with the CIOMS SMQ Working Group, it was decided that signs and symptoms of general eye disorders will be included in a separate SMQ.  Therefore, the final term list for SMQ Lacrimal disorders consists only of narrow terms.  For example, PT Tearfulness was initially included in this SMQ as a broad term because it relates to tears and because it was thought possible that some organizations may have cases coded to PT Tearfulness that represent increased lacrimation of a physiologic nature (due to miscoding).  Please note that this term is linked to SOC Psychiatric disorders under HLT Mood alterations with depressive symptoms.  As noted above, the Working Group decided to leave all broad terms - including PT Tearfulness - out of this SMQ.  Also, LLT X-ray of nasolacrimal duct abnormal is linked to PT Face and mouth X-ray abnormal in MedDRA 12.0, however, this PT has not been included in the term list for this SMQ because it is too broad for inclusion.  The SMQ user may wish to review cases coded to LLT X-ray of nasolacrimal duct abnormal in addition to those retrieved by the included SMQ terms.$13.0$A$N$
20000177$Lipodystrophy (SMQ)$1$HIV associated lipodystrophy: abnormal central fat accumulation (lipohypertrophy) and localized loss of fat tissue (lipoatrophy).  Some patients have only lipohypertrophy or only lipoatrophy; others have a mixed clinical presentation.  Lipohypertrophy and lipoatrophy are distinct entities with different risk factors and underlying metabolic processes.  Lipohypertrophy: enlarged dorsocervical fat pad; circumferential expansion of neck; breast enlargement (including gynecomastia); abdominal visceral fat accumulation and other new fat accumulations that are circumscribed (e.g., lipomas) or general.  Lipoatrophy: peripheral fat wasting; loss of subcutaneous tissue in face, arms, legs, buttocks; involvement of face is most common.  Additional features: hyperlipidemia; insulin resistance; hyperinsulinemia; hyperglycemia; low levels of high density lipoprotein; and increased risk of diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis.  Mechanisms for development are not completely understood.  HIV-1 protease inhibitor drugs and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are implicated as follows: decreased production of retinoic acid and triglyceride uptake; inhibition of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase gamma; inhibition of lipid metabolism; and prevention of development of adipocytes.  Evidence suggests decreased insulin sensitivity, beta-cell dysfunction, and down-regulated estrogen receptor expression in adipose tissue.  In absence of HAART, HIV-1 may itself cause dyslipidemia and lipodystrophy by various mechanisms.  Resting energy expenditure and lipid oxidation are higher in HAART-treated HIV-positive patients with vs. without lipodystrophy.$Robles, DT.

20000178$Osteoporosis/osteopenia (SMQ)$1$Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by: decreased bone mass and deterioration of bone microarchitecture. Osteopenia is a milder form of bone loss.  Increased fracture risk even with minimal trauma; most common sites for bone loss and resultant fractures are thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, ribs, upper femur, lower radius. Usually causes no signs or symptoms except height loss and kyphosis until fractures occur. Pathogenesis: genetics; medications; diet; race; gender; lifestyle; physical activity. Type 1 (postmenopausal) is most common; results from sex hormone deficiency; increased recruitment/responsiveness of osteoclast precursors and increased bone resorption outpace bone formation; decreased trabecular bone leads to an increased risk of Colles and vertebral fractures; estrogen deficiency may cause bone to be more sensitive to parathyroid hormone, leading to increased calcium release from bone, decreased renal calcium excretion, and increased production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D; gonadal deficiency may also increase production of cytokines that have an influence on osteoclasts. Type 2 (senile) occurs in both genders; decreased formation of bone and decreased renal production of 1,25(OH)2 D3 occurring late in life; loss of cortical and trabecular bone leads to increased fracture risk in hip, long bones, vertebrae. Type 3, secondary to medications or due to other conditions that cause increased bone loss by various mechanisms. Bone mineral density frequently used as approximate measure of bone strength. WHO defines osteoporosis as bone density 2.5 standard deviations below mean for young adult white females. Markers of bone turnover (bone specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, type I procollagen peptides,  and urinary deoxypyridinoline) sometimes used to monitor response to therapy$Hobar, C.

20000179$Periorbital and eyelid disorders (SMQ)$1$Eyelids maintain health of underlying eye by protecting cornea and assist in distribution and elimination of tears. Eyelid structure: anterior layer of skin and orbicularis oculi muscle; posterior layer of tarsus and conjunctiva; orbicularis oculi muscles (innervated by CN VII) closes eyelid; upper eyelid is raised by levator muscle (innervated by CN III) and Mueller's muscle; orbital septum - originating from orbital rim - inserts into upper lid and lower lid; septum limits spread of eyelid bleeding or infection to posterior orbital structures.  Glands along eyelid margin contribute to lipid component of tears; may become inflamed; meibomian glands lie within tarsus; pilosebaceous glands of Zeiss and apocrine glands of Moll are anterior to meibomian glands within distal eyelid margin.  Problems that can afflict eyelids: neoplasms; inflammation and infection; and structural problems (e.g., ectropion). Most eyelid disorders do not threaten vision but may produce irritative symptoms (burning, foreign body sensation or pain).  Blepharitis (eyelid inflammation) is characterized by erythematous eyelids with debris accumulation along eyelid margin.$Carter, S.R.  Eyelid disorders: diagnosis and management.  Amer. Fam. Phys. 57:(11), June 1998, http://www.aafp.org/afp/980600ap/carter.html$Following testing and discussions with the CIOMS SMQ Working Group, it was decided that signs and symptoms of general eye disorders will be included in a separate SMQ.  Therefore, the final term list for SMQ Periorbital and eyelid disorders consists only of narrow terms. In addition, some "eyelid" terms at the LLT level have not been included in the term list for this SMQ because their parent PTs may be too broad for inclusion.  The SMQ user may wish to review these LLTs and determine if they wish to capture cases coded with these terms in addition to those retrieved by the included SMQ terms.  These LLTs (MedDRA Version 11.1) are: Erythema circumocular-blepharal, Feeling of warmth blepharal, Hyperpigmentation of eyelid, Hypertrichosis of eyelid, Hypopigmentation of eyelid, Hypotrichosis of eyelid, Numbness of eyelid, Numbness of eyelids, Papular rash circumocular-blepharal, and Xeroderma of eyelid.$13.0$A$N$
20000180$Osteonecrosis (SMQ)$1$Osteonecrosis occurs as a result of compromise to the blood supply to bone. Hip (femoral head) is a common location, but other bones can also be affected. Two main forms: traumatic (more common, due to direct injury and damage of blood supply) and non-traumatic.  Non-traumatic form is associated with several risk factors/conditions including corticosteroid use, alcohol abuse, sickle cell anemia, Gaucher disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, coagulopathies, hyperlipidemia, organ transplantation, caisson disease, thyroid disorders and genetic factors; some cases are idiopathic.Symptoms of osteonecrosis of the femoral head: groin pain (occasionally buttock pain; deep, throbbing and worsens upon walking); and "catching" or popping sensation with motion. Physical examination: pain with range of motion and walking; limitation of internal rotation; Trendelenburg gait often present; plain radiographs of hip are often normal. Osteonecrosis of jaw (ONJ): associated with use of biphosphonates; typically occurs in the setting of recent dental surgery; signs and symptoms include pain, tooth mobility, mucosal swelling, erythema and ulceration.$Osteonecrosis.

20000181$Renovascular disorders (SMQ)$1$Renovascular disorders include: atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (most common primary disease of the renal arteries); fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal arteries; embolic renal artery occlusion; and renovascular microvascular disorders. All can result in renal dysfunction, usually evidenced by high plasma renin levels. Usually present in one of three forms: asymptomatic renal artery stenosis; renovascular hypertension; ischemic nephropathy. Primarily due to constriction of afferent renal artery resulting in decreased perfusion pressure of larger circulation and/or microcirculation. Disorder of larger circulation is commonly due to unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis. Microcirculation disorders are commonly due to small vessel thrombosis from proximal upstream thrombi (e.g., in the stenosed renal artery) or from distal sites (e.g., intracardiac thrombi). Mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced renal dysfunction include: damage to kidney vasculature or structures; hemolytic uremic syndrome; prerenal perfusion deficits. Renovascular disorders may result in progressive severe hypertension with the usual sequelae of this condition.$Bloch MJ, Basile J.
